  "1": "The ventilator utilizes an ultrasonic humidifier to humidify the inspired gases delivered to the patient's airway.",
  "2": "Due to inadequate maintenance or cleaning procedures, biofilm accumulates on the surfaces of the ultrasonic components, including the transducer and water reservoir.",
  "3": "A ventilator with compromised enclosure integrity experiences an electrical fault within its internal components. As a result of the fault, electrical current leaks from the internal circuitry to the metal enclosure of the ventilator.",
  "4": "Ventilator is placed near a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine during routine patient care. The proximity of the ventilator to the MRI machine exposes its electronic components to the magnetic fields.",
  "5": "In a healthcare facility, a ventilator is located in an area with low humidity levels, such as an operating room or intensive care unit. As a result of low humidity, static electricity builds up on the surfaces of the ventilator and its components.",
  "6": "During a power surge or electrical malfunction, the voltage supplied to the ventilator exceeds safe levels, leading to an overvoltage condition in the device.",
  "7": "Incorrect installation of patient arm support causes discomfort and potential injury.",
  "8": "During routine ventilator care in a healthcare facility, a compromised connector within the ventilator's fluid pathway fails to contain the pressurized oxygen supply properly.",
  "9": "Continuous movement over various surfaces, especially rough or abrasive ones, leads to the gradual wear of castor wheels.",
  "10": "A ventilator's internal fan, responsible for generating airflow, develops an imbalance, leading to excessive vibration of the fan blades and surrounding components. Over time, the vibration becomes more pronounced, causing the ventilator housing and nearby components to vibrate noticeably during use.",
  "11": "During transportation, a ventilator's flexible tubing, which connects the ventilator to the patient interface, becomes kinked.",
  "12": "During patient repositioning or movement within the healthcare facility, a ventilator's power cord becomes compressed or pinched between the patient's bed and a heavy piece of medical equipment.",
  "13": "During routine maintenance, a healthcare provider inadvertently places their fingers or hand in a location where moving parts or sharp edges are present.",
  "14": "During an emergency situation, a healthcare provider accidentally pushes the ventilator. The monitor screen, extending beyond the ventilator's body, strikes the wall with force.",
  "15": "Over time, due to repeated cycles of operation and mechanical wear, the tension spring experiences increased stress levels beyond its designed limits.",
  "16": "As the tension spring approaches its fatigue limit, it undergoes plastic deformation, loses its elasticity, and ultimately fails.",
  "17": "During the cleaning procedure, healthcare personnel inadvertently use caustic or corrosive cleaning agents on ventilator components.",
  "18": "Ventilator surfaces become contaminated with pyrogenic substances through contact with contaminated hands.",
  "19": "In the assembly of a ventilator, adhesive solvents are used to bond various components together, such as plastic housing panels or electronic circuitry. Solvent vapors accumulate in the air.",
  "20": "In the manufacturing process of a ventilator, lead-based solder is used to join electronic components on circuit boards and coatings on metal parts. Coatings degrade over time due to wear and corrosion.",
  "21": "In a ventilator, silica gel desiccants are incorporated into the device's internal compartments or filter housings to prevent moisture buildup. Silica gel desiccants release fine silica particles into the air.",
  "22": "An incorrect software update causes a malfunction in the ventilator's alarm system.",
  "23": "Frequent vibrations from a nearby machinery cause loose connections in the ventilator's wiring.",
  "24": "A sudden change in ambient temperature affects the ventilator's internal components, leading to reduced efficiency.",
  "25": "A mechanical part in the ventilator, such as a lever or knob, becomes detached during regular use.",
  "26": "The ventilator's power supply cord is damaged, leading to intermittent power loss.",
  "27": "Improperly sealed ventilator components allow dust and debris to enter and interfere with the device's operation.",
  "28": "A software bug introduces delays in the ventilator's response to user commands.",
  "29": "The ventilator's fan is obstructed by foreign objects, causing overheating of the device.",
  "30": "Water leakage from the humidifier component causes short circuits in the ventilator's electronics.",
