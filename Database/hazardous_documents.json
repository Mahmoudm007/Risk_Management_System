  "1": "The patient is exposed to contaminated air.",
  "2": "Ventilator is placed near the patient, risking direct exposure.",
  "3": "Healthcare provider comes into contact with exposed wiring while handling the ventilator.",
  "4": "Patient comes into contact with a component of the ventilator that is carrying leakage current.",
  "5": "Healthcare provider comes into contact with the grounded chassis or housing of the ventilator while it is leaking current to the ground.",
  "6": "A healthcare provider, unaware of the electrical fault, touches the external surface of the ventilator enclosure while adjusting settings.",
  "7": "This interference disrupts the ventilator's functionality, leading to incorrect readings, erratic operation, or complete failure of the device.",
  "8": "An ESD event occurs near sensitive electronic components of the ventilator, causing damage to the electronic circuitry.",
  "9": "The overvoltage condition can cause damage to the electrical components of the ventilator, including circuit boards, sensors, and control mechanisms.",
  "10": "Patient arm dislodged and fell on the patient.",
  "11": "Pressurized oxygen escapes from the ventilator system in a sudden burst, leading to the injection of oxygen into the eye of a healthcare provider who was adjusting the ventilator settings.",
  "12": "Reduced mobility impacts the accessibility of the ventilator in emergency situations.",
  "13": "A healthcare provider, while adjusting the ventilator settings or performing routine maintenance, comes into contact with the vibrating housing or components.",
  "14": "This bending restricts the flow of air or oxygen through the tubing, compromising the delivery of respiratory support to the patient.",
  "15": "As a result of the compressed power cord, the electrical connection to the ventilator is disrupted. This leads to a loss of power supply to the ventilator, causing it to shut down unexpectedly and interrupting respiratory support to the patient.",
  "16": "The moving parts or sharp edges within the ventilator come into contact with the healthcare provider's hand or fingers, causing lacerations, cuts, or abrasions.",
  "17": "Impaired monitor functionality, readability, or structural integrity. This could affect the accuracy of patient monitoring data displayed on the screen, leading to potential errors in clinical decision-making.",
  "18": "The valve mechanism fails to operate properly, causing irregularities in the flow of respiratory gases.",
  "19": "The cleaning agents used are not properly diluted and corrode metal surfaces, compromising the functionality of the ventilator.",
  "20": "Pyrogens present on the ventilator's surfaces potentially transfer to tubing and connectors.",
  "21": "Healthcare provider working in proximity to the ventilator assembly area inhales these vapors.",
  "22": "Inhalation of dust particles released from malfunctioning ventilator components.",
  "23": "Electrical shorts caused by water ingress in the ventilator.",
  "24": "Exposure to high levels of noise from malfunctioning ventilator fans.",
